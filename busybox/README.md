Alpine Linux is a Linux distribution based on musl and BusyBox, 
primarily designed for security, simplicity, and resource efficiency.
It uses a hardened kernel and compiles all user space binaries 
as position-independent executables with stack-smashing protection. 




The Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)[1] is a family of 
standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining 
compatibility between operating systems. 
POSIX defines the application programming interface (API), 
along with command line shells and utility interfaces, 
for software compatibility with variants of Unix 
and other operating systems.
